These cookies allow our partners to recognize your computer so that the ad server can show you Lotpick.com advertisements elsewhere on the Internet, and so that our analytics software can measure your engagement and interactions while using Lotpick.com services.

This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you, and it allows Lotpick.com to optimize the performance of our advertising campaigns and the usability of our website. In other words, we use analytics data in concert with data about our online ads that have been shown using the Google Display Network, Facebook for Advertisers, or other online advertising networks.
